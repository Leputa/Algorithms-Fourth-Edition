## algs4_Deque

Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues  
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

## algs4_Collinear  
Programming Assignment 3: Pattern Recognition  
Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

## algs4_8puzzle  
Programming Assignment 4: 8puzzle  
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

## algs4_KdTree  
Programming Assignment 5: KdTree  
Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).

## algs4_WordNet  
Programming Assignment 6: WordNet  
WordNet is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's Watson. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, animal is a hypernym of both bird and fish; bird is a hypernym of eagle, pigeon, and seagull.

## algs4_Seam_Carving  
Programming Assignment 7: Seam Carving  
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row. (A horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column.) Below left is the original 505-by-287 pixel image; below right is the result after removing 150 vertical seams, resulting in a 30% narrower image. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (e.g. cropping and scaling), the most interesting features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image are preserved.

## algs4_Baseball_Elimination  
Programming Assignment 8: Baseball Elimination  
Given the standings in a sports division at some point during the season, determine which teams have been mathematically eliminated from winning their division.

## algs4_Boggle  
Programming Assignment 9: Boggle  
Write a program to play the word game Boggle®.

## algs4_Burrows_Wheeler  
Programming Assignment 10: Burrows–Wheeler Data Compression  
Implement the Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm. This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses gzip and PKZIP, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents. It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.
